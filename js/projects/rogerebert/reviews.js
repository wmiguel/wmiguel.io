  { Title: "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari",  Year: "1920", Director: "Robert Wiene", Rating: 4, Review: "The first thing everyone notices and best remembers about 'The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari' (1920) is the film's bizarre look. The actors inhabit a jagged landscape of sharp angles and tilted walls and windows, staircases climbing crazy diagonals, trees with spiky leaves, grass that looks like knives. These radical distortions immediately set the film apart from all earlier ones, which were based on the camera's innate tendency to record reality.", Link: "http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-the-cabinet-of-dr-caligari-1920", YouTube:"" },

  { Title: "City Lights",  Year: "1931", Director: "Charlie Chaplin", Rating: 4, Review: "If only one of Charles Chaplin's films could be preserved, 'City Lights' (1931) would come the closest to representing all the different notes of his genius. It contains the slapstick, the pathos, the pantomime, the effortless physical coordination, the melodrama, the bawdiness, the grace, and, of course, the Little Tramp--the character said, at one time, to be the most famous image on earth.", Link: "http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-city-lights-1931", YouTube:""  },
  { Title: "Dracula",  Year: "1931", Director: "Tod Browning", Rating: 4, Review: "Movie lore has it that Bela Lugosi could barely speak English when he was chosen by Universal Pictures to star in 'Dracula' (1931). Lon Chaney had been scheduled to play the role, a wise casting decision after his success in the silent classics 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame' and 'The Phantom of the Opera.' But he died as 'Dracula' was going into production, and the mysterious 49-year-old Hungarian, who starred in a 1927 Broadway production of 'Dracula,' was cast. Legend must exaggerate, because the Hungarian emigre Lugosi had been living and working in the United States for a decade by the time the film was made, and yet there is something about his line readings that suggests a man who comes sideways to English--perhaps because in his lonely Transylvanian castle, Dracula has had centuries to study it but few opportunities to practice it.", Link: "http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-dracula-1931", YouTube:""  },

  { Title: "King Kong",  Year: "1933", Director: "Merian C. Cooper , Ernest B. Schoedsack", Rating: 4, Review: "On good days I consider 'Citizen Kane' the seminal film of the sound era, but on bad days it is 'King Kong.' That is not to say I dislike 'King Kong,' which, in this age of technical perfection, uses its very naivete to generate a kind of creepy awe. It's simply to observe that this low-rent monster movie, and not the psychological puzzle of 'Kane,' pointed the way toward the current era of special effects, science fiction, cataclysmic destruction, and nonstop shocks. 'King Kong' is the father of 'Jurassic Park,' the 'Alien' movies and countless other stories in which heroes are terrified by skillful special effects. A movie like 'Silence of the Lambs,' which finds its evil in a man's personality, seems humanistic by contrast.", Link: "http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-king-kong-1933", YouTube:""  },

Most movies remain up there on the screen. Only a few penetrate your soul. In May of 1989 I walked out of the screening at the Cannes Film Festival with tears in my eyes. Spike Lee had done an almost impossible thing. He'd made a movie about race in America that empathized with all the participants. He didn't draw lines or take sides but simply looked with sadness at one racial flashpoint that stood for many others.", Link: "http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-do-the-right-thing-1989", YouTube:"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uOeKkJ5F3XY"  },

To romance. To the rest of my life. Or just simply out of town. Trains embody the fact of travel, the sense of moving through time and space and day and night. Airplanes are elevators whose doors close and then open in another city. The two Japanese kids in Jim Jarmusch's 'Mystery Train' (1989) have the right idea. They're on a train to Memphis. With one suitcase suspended on a pole between them, they wander the bedraggled streets until passing by accident the door of the Sun record studios, which is a shrine for them.", Link: "http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-mystery-train-1989", YouTube:"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ubMCpneNtSI?t=1011"  },

  { Title: "GoodFellas",  Year: "1990", Director: "Martin Scorsese", Rating: 4, Review: "As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster. To me, being a gangster was better than being President of the United States. So says Henry Hill in the opening moments of Martin Scorsese’s 'GoodFellas,' a movie about the tradecraft and culture of organized crime in New York. That he narrates his own story--and is later joined by his wife, narrating hers--is crucial to the movie’s success. This is not an outsider’s view, but a point-of-view movie based on nostalgia for the lifestyle. 'They were blue-collar guys,' Hill’s wife explains. 'The only way they could make extra money, real extra money, was to go out and cut a few corners.' Their power was intoxicating. 'If we wanted something, we just took it,' Henry says. 'If anyone complained twice they got hit so bad, believe me, they never complained again.'", Link: "http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-goodfellas-1991", YouTube:"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mt_L8gDfM98"  },

I have no opinion on the factual accuracy of his 1991 film “JFK.” I don't think that's the point. This is not a film about the facts of the assassination, but about the feelings. “JFK” accurately reflects our national state of mind since Nov. 22, 1963. We feel the whole truth has not been told, that more than one shooter was involved, that somehow maybe the CIA, the FBI, Castro, the anti-Castro Cubans, the Mafia or the Russians, or all of the above, were involved. We don't know how. That's just how we feel.", Link: "http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-jfk-1991", YouTube:"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xUxy3_gBMbk"  },

  { Title: "The Silence of the Lambs",  Year: "1991", Director: "Jonathan Demme", Rating: 4, Review: "A fundamental difference between “The Silence of the Lambs” and its sequel, “Hannibal,” is that the former is frightening, involving and disturbing, while the latter is merely disturbing. It is easy enough to construct a geek show if you start with a cannibal. The secret of “Silence” is that it doesn't start with the cannibal--it arrives at him, through the eyes and minds of a young woman. “Silence of the Lambs” is the story of Clarice Starling, the FBI trainee played by Jodie Foster, and the story follows her without substantial interruption. Dr. Hannibal Lecter lurks at the heart of the story, a malevolent but somehow likable presence--likable because he likes Clarice, and helps her. But Lecter, as played by Anthony Hopkins, is the sideshow, and Clarice is in the center ring.", Link: "https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-the-silence-of-the-lambs-1991", YouTube:"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fgX0hASKpBU"  },

Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. 'Shawshank' slows down and looks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars.

  { Title: "A.I. Artificial Intelligence",  Year: "2001", Director: "Steven Speilberg", Rating: 4, Review: "Stanley Kubrick always referred to the story as 'Pinocchio.' It mirrored the tale of a puppet who dreams of becoming a real boy. And what, after all, is an android but a puppet with a computer program pulling its strings? The project that eventually became Steven Spielberg's 'A. I. Artificial Intelligence' (2001) was abandoned by Kubrick because he wasn't satisfied with his approaches to its central character, David, an android who appears to be a real little boy. Believing special effects wouldn't be adequate and a human actor would seem too human, he turned the project over to his friend Spielberg. Legend has it he made that decision after being impressed by Spielberg's special effects in 'Jurassic Park,' but perhaps 'E. T.' was also an influence: If Spielberg could create an alien who evoked human emotions, could he do the same with an android?", Link: "http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-ai-artificial-intelligence-2001", YouTube:"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lJb29Kw2tNk"  },

The fauns and fantasies are seen only by the 11-year-old heroine, but that does not mean “she's only dreaming;” they are as real as the fascist captain who murders on the flimsiest excuse. The coexistence of these two worlds is one of the scariest elements of the film; they both impose sets of rules that can get an 11-year-old killed.", Link: "http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-pans-labyrinth-2006", YouTube:""  },
