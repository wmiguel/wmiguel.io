    Lyrics: `
      Softly the crystals falling on 17th Street<br>
      Do their dance and die and are gone<br>
      Millions of crystal balls roll around your feet<br>
      Nothing gets done<br>
      <br>
      An hour goes by; she doesn't<br>
      <br>
      If you don't cry<br>
      It isn't love<br>
      If you don't cry<br>
      Then you just don't feel it deep enough<br>
      <br>
      Dying all day in thousands of little ways<br>
      Dancing alone and drinking a lot<br>
      Closing the clubs and haunting the cabarets<br>
      Looking for what?<br>
      <br>
      Another five years off your life<br>
      <br>
      If you don't cry<br>
      It isn't love<br>
      If you don't cry<br>
      Then you just don't feel it deep enough<br>
      <br>
      A year goes by; she doesn't<br>
      <br>
      If you don't cry<br>
      It isn't love<br>
      If you don't cry<br>
      Then you just don't feel it deep enough<br>
      <br>
      If you don't cry<br>
      It isn't love<br>
      If you don't cry<br>
      Then you just don't feel it deep enough`,

      If someone told me you'd be here<br>
      Whispering these familiar things<br>
      Talking to my little pets<br>
      Smoking the same old cigarettes<br>
      I would have laughed<br>
      I saw you last in summertime<br>

      But I have lost my sense of humor<br>
      My medication's wearing off<br>
      Or it's just not strong enough<br>
      To cover this<br>
      And then you kiss me like before<br>
      And I find myself wanting more<br>
      And you tell that little lie<br>
      That kept me hypnotized:<br>
      Another kiss<br>

      If someone said I'd be so dumb<br>
      After all the sleepless nights<br>
      When I turned on all the lights<br>
      I would have hit them<br>
      But I have turned the other cheek<br>
      My voice trembles, my knees are weak<br>
      And you beat me once again<br>
      And I know what happens then<br>
      You raise the ante<br>

      It costs a lot more than it's worth<br>
      And yet there is no substitute<br>
      <br>
      They keep it on a higher shelf<br>
      The older and more pure it grows<br>
      It has no color in itself<br>
      But it can make you see rainbows<br>
      <br>
      You can find it on the Bowery<br>
      Or you can find it at Elaine's<br>
      It makes your words more flowery<br>
      It makes the sun shine, makes it rain<br>
      <br>
      You just get out what they put in<br>
      And they never put in enough<br>

      <br>
      If you really loved me<br>
      You'd buy me a beautiful pearl<br>
      But you've already bought me<br>
      All of the pearls in the world<br>
      So there's one thing I crave<br>
      When my days become ho-hum and blah<br>
      I want a zebra<br>
      <br>
      We've got so many tchotchkes<br>
      We've practically emptied the Louvre<br>
      In most of our palaces<br>
      There's hardly room to maneuver<br>
      Well I shan't go to Bali today<br>
      I must stay home and hoovre<br>
      Up the gold dust<br>
      That doesn't mean we're in love<br>
      <br>
      If you really loved me<br>
      You'd buy me the Great Pyramid<br>
      Oh, I'm so forgetful, you already did<br>
      But there's one thing I need<br>
      If you won't think I'm greedy, my dear<br>
      Another zebra<br>
      Zelda looks lonely, I want a zebra`,
