      For I have loved<br>
      And so I lost the world above<br>
      Beyond the moss…<br>

      There's an hour of sunshine<br>
      For a million years of rain<br>

      When love falls from the sky<br>
      Nobody ever asks why<br>
      You just take it or you leave it<br>
      Where it was<br>

      You can spend your life dreaming of<br>

      For the love of a sweet-lovin' man<br>
      Some have traveled far and wide<br>
      Some have given up and died<br>
      For the love of a sweet-lovin' man<br>
      Some have broken down and cried<br>
      Some have turned to dust inside<br>
      But I'll stay right here and hide<br>
      In the arms of my sweet-lovin' man<br>
      <br>
      Until you've had sweet lovin'<br>
      There's no lovin' worth the name<br>
      But you can go blind<br>
      From crying all the time<br>
      And who said life was easy<br>
      And who said a man was fair<br>
      Well I wish you well<br>
      But keep your paws off mine<br>
      You can't buy one at the mall<br>
      But he'll come if you just call…<br>
